					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge was to use our debugging knowledge to fix old assignments. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Surprisingly, we didn't have any problems with our old code that needed debugging. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I definitely think we've implemented a form of debugging in the past when working on our previous labs, which is why they were bug-free in the end. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<!--Main output div-->
					<p> The results are our previous labs working without any bugs. </p>

				<h2>Debugging</h2>
